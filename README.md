# new-repo

This repo contains scripts I've made in Bash and Python. I have been teaching myself both of these languages over the past few months and these are scripts that I've created to make my life easier.
There are also some games I've created to practice data structures and concepts. 

I will add some puppet modules that I have created. Please keep in mind that the modules are made using puppet 2.7 (Yeah I know)
